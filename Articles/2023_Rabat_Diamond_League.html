<h1>2023 Rabat Diamond League</h1>
<h4>Blair Mitchell, AP Sports Journalist</h4>
<p>The second stop in the fourteen-meet Diamond League season took place on Monday, May 29th in Rabat,
    Morocco.</p>
<p>The men’s 110-meter hurdles saw the greatly anticipated showdown between defending World
    Champion Grant Holloway, defending Olympic Champion Hansle Parchment, and Olympian Devon Allen.
    Holloway was the favorite coming into the race with the fastest season best time of 13.03 seconds. As expected,
    Holloway had his usual exhilarating start, with about a 3-meter lead from the rest of the pack coming
    over the 3rd hurdle. But over the final two hurdles Rasheed Broadwell tracked Holloway and the rest of
    the field down, winning the race and setting a new meet record of 13.08.</p>
<p>The women’s and men’s 1500-meter races were both stacked with world class talent and some fast
    times were definitely expected coming into the race. On the women’s side it was a complete
    domination by the Ethiopian athletes in the field, with the top four finishers all being Ethiopian. It was
    not much of a close race either due to defending World Indoor Champion Gudaf Tsegay. From the very
    start of the race the field became spread out and Tsegay was the one leading the way with Freweyni
    Hailu trailing right behind her. It was close between the two for about 1000 meters until Tsegay really
    put the hammer down and separated herself from Hailu. Tsegay finished the race setting a new meet
    record running 3:54.03, which was just barely off her personal best in the event of 3:54.01.</p>
<p>In the men’s race all eyes were on defending Olympic Champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen and 2019 NCAA Champion Yared
    Nuguse. Both athletes have run incredible times in this event and are both expected to contend for a
    medal in Budapest this year. The race itself went as much as to be expected, with Ingebrigtsen leading
    the pack for much of it with Ollie Hoare and Nuguse trailing right behind him. As the final 100 meters
    approached Ingebrigtsen made his final kick, leaving both Hoare and Nuguse who neither could respond
    to Ingebrigtsen’s move. Looking rather comfortable and relaxed throughout the whole race Ingebrigtsen
    started off his 2023 campaign with an impressive time of 3:32.59 which ranks as the fourth fastest time
    in the world at the time of the meet.</p>
<p>As we looked back on the track it was time for the main event of the day, the men’s 100-meter dash.
    The drama leading up to this race was definitely at an all-time high, with defending Olympic Champion
    Marcell Jacobs and defending World Champion Fred Kerley set to face off. Unluckily for the both of
    them and for us as viewers, Jacobs had to pull out of the race due to injury. Despite this unfortunate
    news, this stacked field of runners still had bronze medalist from Oregon Trayvon Bromell, World
    Champion Yohan Blake, up and coming young star Letsile Tebogo, Kerley and many other world-class
    athletes. Immediately out of the blocks Akani Simbine and Bromell got out to a great start. But to be
    expected, Kerley came through in the final 60 meters and powered his way past the other runners and
    threw up a celebration before even crossing the finish line. Kerley finished the race in 9.94, setting a
    new meet record and beating second place finisher Simbine by 0.05 seconds. Bromell did not have a
    great race and ended up placing 5th in 10.10 seconds.</p>
<p>To close out an exciting meet with already many great performances we saw one more on track in the
    men’s 3000-meter steeplechase. Defending Olympic and World Champion Souufiane El Bakkali put on a
    show for his home crowd in Morocco. Coming into the race there was almost no doubt El Bakkali would
    take the win, it was just a matter of what he would run. And well in short it was an all-time great
    performance. Not only did he run a new meet record and run a new personal best of 7:56.68. He also
    managed to beat the current world leading time before this meet by almost 20 seconds.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the next coming weeks, we have a lot more big time meets to get excited for. The
    next Diamond League meeting is on June 2nd in Florence, Italy followed by Paris, France the following
    weekend.</p>
