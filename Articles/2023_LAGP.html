<p>The 2023 outdoor track and field season is officially underway with some already incredible
    performances having been showcased throughout the month of May.</p>
<p>To start off the eventful weekend we take a trip to the City of Angels in Southern California, where the
    2023 Los Angeles Grand Prix took place on Friday, May 26th and Saturday, May 27th. Track and field fans
    from all around came out to the event to watch these world class athletes perform, with much of the
    stands packed throughout the day.</p>
<p>The men’s and women’s hammer throw popped off the event with the defending Olympic Champion
    Wojciech Nowicki coming out with the win and throwing a mark of 77.18 meters, which narrowly bested
    Rudy Winkler’s throw of 77.17 meters. Both athletes are ranked top 10 in the world for the hammer
    throw, and we should definitely have an eye out for them during the World Championships this August
    in Budapest.</p>
<p>The women’s hammer throw showed cased Camryn Rogers’ ability to dominate with an impressive
    throw of 78.62 meters, beating second place by over 2 meters. She won the silver in Oregon last year
    and she definitely looks to improve on that this year.</p>
<p>In the women’s pole vault, the American record holder and two-time world indoor champion in the
    event, Sandi Morris, took first place with a mark of 4.61 meters. On the men’s side Armand Duplantis
    continued to display his dominance in the sport, placing first with a mark of 5.91 meters.</p>
<p>The longest race of the meet closed out the first day of the LA Grand Prix and it did not disappoint. In
    the women’s 5000 meters Elise Cranny ran away from the rest of the pack with about four laps to go
    but was tracked down by a group of runners led by Emily Lipari with about 800 to go. Lipari won the race
    in a time of 15:08.87, which put her third in the world this year at the time of the meet. In the men’s
    race 2x NCAA DI champion Abdihamid Nur managed to pull out a win and make the World
    Championship qualifying mark after a rough start to the race where he collapsed in the first 200 meters.
    He was able to claw himself back from last to first and still had a kick to pull away from the pack in the
    final 400. His time of 13:05.17 placed him as the fastest 5k runner in the world this year at the time of
    the meet.</p>
<p>As we looked back on the track following the pole vault, we saw a confident win by 2016 Olympic Bronze
    medalist Clayton Murphy in the Men’s 800 meters. The competitors in this race were definitely well
    acquainted with each other, with six out of the nine runners on the starting line being American.
    Murphy’s PR of 1:42.93 from the 2016 Olympics was the fastest personal best out of anyone in the field
    coming into the race, followed by his two fellow American teammates Bryce Hoppel and Isaiah Jewett.
    Right from the gun Rajay Hamilton and Jewett took the early lead side by side through the first 380
    meters. With around 420 meters to go, Isaiah Harris surged to the front and pulled the runners through
    the first lap at 51.33 seconds. As Jewett and Harris battled for the lead, more of the field began to
    spread out and the fast finishers in the race started to reel the two runners in. Once the pacer stepped
    off the track with 200 meters to go, Harris, Jewett, and Kameron Jones immediately started to kick away
    from the rest of the runners, and it looked to be a three-man race. But with a crazy finish in the last 100
    meters by Murphy and Festus Lagat, they were able to out kick the rest of the field and take first and
    second place respectively.</p>
<p>Ajee Wilson won the women’s 800-meter race in 1:59.01 against some great competiton. Coming all the
    way back from fifth to first in the final lap, Wilson really showed her strength at the end of the race,
    especially in the final 100m. 2019 World Champion Halimah Nakaayi and Wilson found themselves in a
    two-way battle coming out of the final curve and Wilson was the one to pull away in the last 30 meters.</p>
<p>The accolades continue to follow for the reigning World and Olympic Champion Ryan Crouser in the
    men’s shot put. Crouser came into this meet already holding the world record in the event and he was
    able to beat his record, throwing 23.56 meters. He beat second place finisher Tom Walsh by over 1.44
    meters.</p>
<p>After dealing with injuries over the past year, the men’s 200 meters saw a nice return to racing for
    Terrance Laird who ran 20.08 to win the race. It was definitely not an easy win for Laird though because
    on his inside in lane 4 was the 2022 World Indoor Champion in the 400 meters, Jereem Richards, who
    also held the fastest personal best out of everyone in the race at 19.80. It was neck and neck between
    the two runners the whole straight away and it ended with Laird besting Richards across the line by .02 seconds.</p>
<p>The men’s and women’s 100-meter dash capped off the LA Grand Prix and there were many surprising
    results from both races. On the men’s side the obvious favorites coming into the meet were 2019 World
    Champion Christian Coleman and Olympian Marvin Bracy. Out of the blocks Christian Coleman did not
    have his usual blistering start and it definitely cost him because in the final 50 meters Ackeem Blake and
    Cravont Charleston pulled away from both him and Bracy. Ackeem Blake won the race with a new
    personal best of 9.89 followed by Cravont Charleston in 9.91. Unfortunately, in the women’s race the
    consensus pre-race favorites Sha’Carri Richardson and Marie-Josee Ta Lou did not show up for the finals.
    In their absence Morolake Akinosun came away with the win and ran 10.97.</p>
